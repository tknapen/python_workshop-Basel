While the syntax of basic Python (as we've gone over in the previous section) is important to do data analysis in Python, knowing numpy is **essential**. Basicially, Numpy is the go-to package whenever you want to do (anything related to) data analysis in Python. Make sure you understand what is going on in this section, as the rest of the course will feature a lot of Numpy-code!\n",

This is, just like basic lists/dictionaries/integers/tuples, a data structure (or class of object) with its own syntax, operations, and methods, as we will explain below."

You might think that such a data structure that only allows one single data type is not ideal. However, the very fact that it only contains a single data-type makes operations on numpy arrays extremely fast. For example, loops over numpy arrays are often way faster than loops over python lists. This is because, internally, Python has to check the data-type of each loop entry before doing something with that entry. Because numpy arrays one allow a single data-type, it only has to check for the entries' data type **once**. If you imagine looping over an array or list of length 100,000, you probably understand that the numpy loop is way faster.\n",

In other words, standardization subtracts the mean (across rows) of each column from the values in that column, and then divides those value with the standard deviation of that column.
