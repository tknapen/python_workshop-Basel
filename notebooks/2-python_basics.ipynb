    "### 1.1. Structure of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a multipurpose programming language, meaning it can be used for almost anything. While R is mostly used for statistics, and php is used for web programming only, Python is a general language, specified by the packages you add on to it (using import statements). So, \"pure\" Python provides some basic functionality, but Python's versatility comes from specialized packages for almost any purpose. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "* the [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) package provides functionality for scientific computing (e.g. statistics, signal processing);\n",
    "* the [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) package provides data structures and functionality for (very fast) numeric computing (e.g. multidimensional numeric array computations, some linear algebra);\n",
    "* the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) package provides plotting functions;\n",
    "* and various specialied neuroimaging packages provide functionality to work and analyze (f)MRI (e.g. [nibabel](http://nipy.org/nibabel/) and [nipype](http://nipy.org/nipype)) and MEG/EEG (e.g. [MNE](http://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, there are packages for everything you can think of (also: creating websites, game programming, etc.)! In this course, we will mostly use basic Python in combination with the scientific computing packages ('numpy', 'scipy') and specialized neuroimaging packages ('nibabel', 'nipype').  "

    "# Object-Oriented Programming in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses the concept of \"objects\" to design software. \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are defined by their properties (attributes) and behavior (methods). For example, a car is an object with properties like color, make, and model, and behavior like driving and honking. This is a very intuitive way of thinking about software design, and it's used in many programming languages, including Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, objects are instances of classes, which represent real-world entities. Classes define the properties and behavior of objects, and can be thought of as 'factories' of objects. Properties of objects are represented by variables, and behavior is represented by functions, which are called methods in the context of classes. The variables of an object can be accessed using the dot notation, like `object.variable`, and the methods can be called using the dot notation, like `object.method()`. The state of an object is stored in its attributes, and its behavior is defined by its methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, classes are defined using the `class` keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. The body of the class is indented, just like in functions and control structures. The class definition can contain class attributes, which are shared by all instances of the class, and methods, which define the behavior of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an object, you call the class as if it were a function, like `object = ClassName()`. This calls the class's `__init__` method, which is a special method that initializes the object. The `__init__` method can take arguments, which are passed when the object is created. The `self` parameter is a reference to the object itself, and is used to access the object's attributes and methods.\n",

This is useful when you have classes that are similar but have some differences. In Python, a class can inherit from another class by including the name of the parent class in parentheses after the class name. The child class can then access the attributes and methods of the parent class, and can override them or add new ones.\n",

You can handle exceptions using a `try` statement, which allows you to catch exceptions that are raised in the `try` block and handle them in the `except` block. This is useful when you want to handle errors gracefully and prevent your program from crashing.\n",

    "One important thing to do is to always specify the type of exception you want to catch. This prevents you from catching exceptions that you didn't intend to catch. For example, if you catch a `FileNotFoundError` exception when you were expecting a `ValueError` exception, your program might behave unexpectedly. You can catch multiple exceptions by putting them in a tuple. But you should never just `pass` on an exception without handling it, because this can hide bugs in your code.\n",

    "The main point to realize is that sometimes you *want* your code to crash when an exception is raised, because it indicates that something is wrong.
