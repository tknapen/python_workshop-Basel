# The repository for the April 18-19 2024 Python workshop on Programming and Reproducible Science in Basel.

### Topics of the workshop include:
- Jupyter notebooks as a tool for data analysis and publication
- Python programming language for data analysis
- Use of Git and GitHub for managing scientific projects and code
- Reproducible programming practices (any language)

### Infrastructure
The course consists of a few notebooks, some python code and data - and this readme. It resides in a GitHub repository, which is open to anyone, also after the course.
For the workshop, we will use Google Colab, a cloud-based Jupyter notebook service. This means that you don't have to install anything on your computer, but can run the code in the notebooks in your browser.

### Startup
- After the first instruction, you will go to GitHub and create a user account there.
  - After this first registration you can have GitHub convert your account to an education account, which enhances your account for free - but that's for later.
- Once you have a GitHub account and are logged in, you can go to the course repository and `fork` it - there's a button on the right top. Forking copies the repository over to your user account, but instead of just copying, it retains the possibility of automatically recombining your version and mine in the future.
- Now that you have your own version of the code repo(sitory), you can open each of the notebooks in Google Colab.
- In Google Colab, you can run the code in the notebooks, and also edit it. You can save your changes to your own version of the notebook, but you can't save them back to my repository.
